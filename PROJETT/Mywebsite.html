            Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates,
             has been sailing the worldâ€™s seas for over 1000 chapters now. 
             He is now closer to achieving his dream of finding One Piece and 
             becoming the Pirate King than he has ever been.
             Though Luffy set out to the sea all on his own,
             he gradually gathered a crew of talented individuals who are
            now one of the most renowned crews in the world of One Piece. 
            The story behind each Straw Hat joining the crew is impactful enough on its own. 
            Because Luffy gained their respect, they wholeheartedly believe that will he be the Pirate King.

                <h3>ZORO</h3>
            <p>
                Zoro's faith in Luffy has been unshaken since the very start. 
                He was the first person to acknowledge                 
                that Luffy will become King of the Pirates.
                 After his fight with Mihawk, 
                Zoro was ashamed of his defeat.

        <div class="yellow"> 
            <h3>SANJI</h3>
             <p>
                Sanji's faith in Luffy goes beyond that of a
                 captain and crew member relationship. 
                Luffy helped him realize his dream to search for
                 All Blue and offered him a place on his ship.

                <h3>NAMI</h3>
                 <p>
                    Even covered with wounds, Nami reminisced
                     about her past when she first asked Luffy for help,  
                     ignoring the threat to her life,
                     Nami couldn't bring herself to say that Luffy won't
                     become the Pirate King because she didn't believe that.

                <h4>Zoro</h4>
                <p>Another iconic moment was his
                     encounter with Kuma at the Thriller Bark,
                      where Zoro begged the Warlord to take his life
                    instead of Luffy's since the latter is destined to
                      become the King of the Pirates. He raised his sword from his injuries and told Luffy about his conviction referring him as King of the Pirates.</p>

                <h4>Sanji</h4>
                <p>Captain Bege apprehended Sanji on Big Mom's behalf and
                     offered to take Luffy and the other Straw Hats 
                     under an Emperor's banner. However, Sanji vehemently refused,
                    saying that Luffy is not a man who will settle with being someone's
                     underlying since he is the future Pirate King</p>

                <h4>Nami</h4>
                <p>Because of her past, Nami always hated pirates 
                    and believed them to be evil people with 
                    no bottom line. However, getting to know Luffy has
                     been an eye-opener for her. She became the Straw Hats official navigator.
                       Despite always being angry at Luffy, 
                    she trusts him the most in the crew</p>
