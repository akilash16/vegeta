            Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates,
             has been sailing the world’s seas for over 1000 chapters now. 
             He is now closer to achieving his dream of finding One Piece and 
             becoming the Pirate King than he has ever been.
             Though Luffy set out to the sea all on his own,
             he gradually gathered a crew of talented individuals who are
            now one of the most renowned crews in the world of One Piece. 
            The story behind each Straw Hat joining the crew is impactful enough on its own. 
            Because Luffy gained their respect, they wholeheartedly believe that will he be the Pirate King.

            One Piece is known for being a light-hearted anime full of action, adventure, and comedy. Following a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy, who sets out to the sea all alone to become king of the pirates, Luffy gathers strong and reliable allies who each have their own goals in life. One Piece starts out as an exceptionally cheerful adventure story but as more mysteries unfold, fans learn exactly how dark the world truly is.

            One Piece is a simple story about a treasure hunt. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a happy-go-lucky boy harbouring the powers of a “Devil Fruit” that turned his body into rubber. He sets sail for the Grand Line (a colossal planet-spanning sea) in search of the fabled treasure known only as “One Piece”. What follows is a massive island hopping adventure– which allows Luffy to slowly assemble an equally ambitious crew, battle rival pirates, and fight off Marines
