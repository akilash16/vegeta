            Monkey D. Luffy, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates,
             has been sailing the world’s seas for over 1000 chapters now. 
             He is now closer to achieving his dream of finding One Piece and 
             becoming the Pirate King than he has ever been.
             Though Luffy set out to the sea all on his own,
             he gradually gathered a crew of talented individuals who are
            now one of the most renowned crews in the world of One Piece. 
            The story behind each Straw Hat joining the crew is impactful enough on its own. 
            Because Luffy gained their respect, they wholeheartedly believe that will he be the Pirate King.

                <h4>Zoro</h4>
                <p>Another iconic moment was his
                     encounter with Kuma at the Thriller Bark,
                      where Zoro begged the Warlord to take his life
                    instead of Luffy's since the latter is destined to
                      become the King of the Pirates. He raised his sword from his injuries and told Luffy about his conviction referring him as King of the Pirates.</p>

                <p>Captain Bege apprehended Sanji on Big Mom's behalf and
                     offered to take Luffy and the other Straw Hats 
                     under an Emperor's banner. However, Sanji vehemently refused,
                    saying that Luffy is not a man who will settle with being someone's
                     underlying since he is the future Pirate King</p>

                <p>Because of her past, Nami always hated pirates 
                    and believed them to be evil people with 
                    no bottom line. However, getting to know Luffy has
                     been an eye-opener for her. She became the Straw Hats official navigator.
                       Despite always being angry at Luffy, 
                    she trusts him the most in the crew</p>

                <p> Being the strongest and the most respectable Fishman, 
                    Jinbe had a lot of responsibilities on his shoulder.
                     Following Whitebeard's death, 
                    he joined Big Mom's banner to protect his people. However, 
                    when Luffy came to Whole Cake Island and reunited with Jinbe, 
                    he told him that he will be waiting for Jinbe in the Land of Wano.
                    Jinbe didn't hesitate to put forth his request in front of Big Mom to leave her crew

                <h4>Robin</h4>
                <p>Much like most Straw Hats, Robin never found a place she could call home until she joined Luffy's crew. 
                    She holds everyone in the crew dear to her, especially 
                    after they saved her from the World Government. 
                    Sanji was helpless against a female opponent and thus, could only call Robin for help.
                    Robin was elated to see Sanji trust her so much.
                    Seeing Black Maria insult Sanji and 
                    calling him a laughingstock didn't sit well

                <p>Having been kicked out of his group by his 
                    reindeer family and then hated by humans, 
                    Chopper never truly had a place he could belong. 
                    He was happy living with his foster father,
                     who also passed away not long after. 
                     It wasn't until he joined Luffy's crew that 
                     he finally became a pirate and realized his dream.
                     Chopper was eager to save the kids who were being experimented on by Ceaser.

            One Piece is known for being a light-hearted anime full of action, adventure, and comedy. Following a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy, who sets out to the sea all alone to become king of the pirates, Luffy gathers strong and reliable allies who each have their own goals in life. One Piece starts out as an exceptionally cheerful adventure story but as more mysteries unfold, fans learn exactly how dark the world truly is.

            One Piece is a simple story about a treasure hunt. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a happy-go-lucky boy harbouring the powers of a “Devil Fruit” that turned his body into rubber. He sets sail for the Grand Line (a colossal planet-spanning sea) in search of the fabled treasure known only as “One Piece”. What follows is a massive island hopping adventure– which allows Luffy to slowly assemble an equally ambitious crew, battle rival pirates, and fight off Marines
